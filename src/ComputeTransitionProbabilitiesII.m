%   P = ComputeTransitionProbabilitiesII(stateSpace, controlSpace,
%   disturbanceSpace, mazeSize, walls, targetCell, holes, resetCell)
%   computes the transition probabilities between all states in the state
%   space for all attainable control inputs.
%
%   Input arguments:
%
%       stateSpace:
%           A (MN x 2) matrix, where the i-th row represents the i-th
%           element of the state space. Note that the state space also
%           contains the target cell, in order to simplify state indexing.
%
%       controlSpace:
%           A (L x 2) matrix, where the l-th row represents the l-th
%           element of the control space.
%
%       disturbanceSpace:
%           A (S x 3) matrix 'disturbanceSpace', where the first two
%           columns of each row represent an element of the disturbance
%           space, and the third column represents the corresponding
%           probability.
%
%       mazeSize:
%           A (1 x 2) matrix containing the width and the height of the
%           maze in number of cells.
%
%   	walls:
%          	A (2 x 2K) matrix containing the K wall segments, where the start
%        	and end point of the k-th segment are stored in column 2k-1
%         	and 2k, respectively.
%
%    	targetCell:
%          	A (2 x 1) matrix describing the position of the target cell in
%         	the maze.
%
%    	holes:
%         	A (2 x H) matrix containg the H holes of the maze. Each column
%         	represents the position of a hole.
%
%   	resetCell:
%         	A (2 x 1) matrix describing the position of the reset cell in
%           the maze.
%
%   Output arguments:
%
%       P:
%           A (MN x MN x L) matrix containing the transition probabilities
%           between all states in the state space for all attainable
%           control inputs. The entry P(i, j, l) represents the transition
%           probability from state i to state j if control input l is
%           applied.
